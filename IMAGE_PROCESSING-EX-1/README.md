### These 7 python scripts provide a solid foundation for experimenting with OpenCV's capabilities. 

## Notes:
Dependencies: Ensure you have OpenCV (opencv-python) and NumPy installed (pip install opencv-python numpy).
Input Image: Place an image named input_image.jpg in the same directory as the scripts.
Output: Each script displays the result and saves it to a file (e.g., contours_output.jpg).
Function Names: Each function is named exactly as specified (e.g., Advanced_Mouse_Interaction, Painting_Transparency, etc.).
Latest Algorithms: The scripts use modern OpenCV functions like cv2.findContours with RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.adaptiveThreshold with Gaussian method, and cv2.minAreaRect for optimal results.
Error Handling: Each script checks if the input image is loaded correctly.
