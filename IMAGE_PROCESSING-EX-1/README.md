### These 7 python scripts provide a solid foundation for experimenting with OpenCV's capabilities. 

## Notes: <br>
Dependencies: Ensure you have OpenCV (opencv-python) and NumPy installed (pip install opencv-python numpy). <br>
Input Image: Place an image named input_image.jpg in the same directory as the scripts.  <br>
Output: Each script displays the result and saves it to a file (e.g., contours_output.jpg).  <br>
Function Names: Each function is named exactly as specified (e.g., Advanced_Mouse_Interaction, Painting_Transparency, etc.). <br>
Latest Algorithms: The scripts use modern OpenCV functions like cv2.findContours with RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.adaptiveThreshold with Gaussian method, and cv2.minAreaRect for optimal results. <br>
Error Handling: Each script checks if the input image is loaded correctly. <br>
